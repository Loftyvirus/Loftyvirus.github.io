After cloning the [projectBCA](https://github.com/Loftyvirus/projectBCA) repository and setting up the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:  

1. Ensure your backend service has a properly structured `.env` file as follows:  

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3307
   DB_NAME=bca
   DB_USER=
   DB_PASSWORD=
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret
   ```

2. The backend's running local port will serve as the base URL for the frontend (Vite).  

3. Run both the backend and frontend simultaneously.  

4. Before proceeding, set up MySQL Dump for the initial database structure. Refer to [How to use the MySQL Dump](#how-to-use-the-mysql-dump) for details.  

5. Log in as an admin/supreme user to add papers.

# Project BCA: MySQL Data and Schema Backup

This repository contains a MySQL database dump of the `bca` database, including both data and schema for most tables. The `supreme` table is configured to include only the schema (structure) without data.

---

## Contents of the ZIP Archive

- **`data_schema_mysql.zip`**: Contains the MySQL dump for the `bca` database.
  - All tables include both schema and data.
  - The `supreme` table contains only the schema (no data).

---

## How to Use the MySQL Dump

Follow these steps to import the MySQL dump into your database.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- MySQL Server (or MariaDB)
- MySQL client tools (`mysqldump`, `mysql` command line)

### Steps to Import

1. **Download the ZIP File**  
   Download `data_schema_mysql.zip` from the releases section.

2. **Extract the ZIP File**  
   Extract the contents to locate the `exportfile.sql` dump file.

3. **Access Your MySQL Database**  
   Connect to your MySQL server using the command line:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

4. **Create the Database (if not existing)**  
   Create the `bca` database if it doesnâ€™t already exist:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bca;
   ```

5. **Import the MySQL Dump**  
   Import the SQL dump into the `bca` database:

   ```sql
   USE bca;
   SOURCE /path/to/exportfile.sql;
   ```

6. **Verify the Import**  
   Check that the tables were imported successfully:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```
   - All tables will include data except for the `supreme` table, which will only have the schema.

---

## Additional Notes

1. **`exportfile.sql`**: The `supreme` table contains only the schema. For adding data to the `supreme` table, use the separate file provided.
2. Ensure the instructions are clear, especially for users new to MySQL or those needing detailed setup guidance.
